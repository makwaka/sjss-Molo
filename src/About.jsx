          St. Joseph Seminary Molo was established between 1986-1984 in Nakuru diocese. Its main goal is to transform young men from all over the country to serve the church through priesthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          St. Joseph Junior Seminary is a Catholic boarding school located 4KM from Molo town. The institution is situated in a serene environment conducive for learning. We offer a holistic growth of students by embracing not only a culture of performance but also self-growth. Our students are engaged in both class and out-of-class activities.

          There are clubs in school that help improve the confidence and self-fulfillment of students. These clubs include:
        </p>
        <ol className="clubs">
          <li>Drama Club</li>
          <li>Scouts' Club</li>
          <li>Music Club</li>
          <li>Young Farmers' Club</li>
          <li>Environmental Club</li>
          <li>Fitness Club</li>
          <li>St. John's Ambulance</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The teachers act as patrons of the above clubs while learners are tasked with coming up with projects in a self-directed manner. The students engage in debates/mijadala every week, tackling issues affecting them and national issues. This greatly improves their expression, sharpening their grammar and public-speaking skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          The school is headed by two priests: the Rector and the Vice-Rector, who also acts as a spiritual director. The students are also involved in the school administration through a strong and vibrant prefects' body tasked with channeling student grievances.
